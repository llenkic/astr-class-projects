Part (b)

To run:
	$python
	>>>import prob2 as p2
	>>>p2.photon_scat(*)

where * can be any negative number corresponding to how deep within the material the
photons are starting at
	
Requirements:
	- none
	
Output:
	- prints to terminal the number of escaped photons that are in the high mode, the
	  total number of escapes photons, and the fraction of high mode photons that 
	  escaped
	- plots the angular distribution of low and high mode photons in a file named
	  *_Below.png where star corresponds to the user input distance
