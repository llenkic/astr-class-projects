Homework 2 README

=========================================================================================
Question 1 
=========================================================================================
To run:
	$python prob1.py
	
Requirements:
	- program looks for a file called homework_2.txt in the same directory
	- if the data file is not found, an error is thrown and program exits
	- the path to the desired data file may be adjusted in line 33
	
Output:
	- the estimated parameters for the Lorentzian and Guassian fits will be printed
	  to the terminal with one-sigma error bars 
	- the reduced chi square value for each fit will be printed to the terminal
	- a figure with the data, Lorenztian, and Gaussian fits will appear

Question 2
=========================================================================================
Part (a)
To run:
	python
	from prob2a import hsphere_vol
	hsphere_vol(10)

Requirements:
	- none

Output:
	- estimated volume for each N with uncertainties and number of points that fall in 
	  hypersphere

Part (b)
To run:
	python prob2b.py

Requirements:
	- none

Output:
	- estimated mass for each N with uncertainties and number of points that fall in 
	  volume
	- plot of above results in "Masses.png"
	- 3D plot of volume in Volume.png
