=================================================================================================
Question 1 
=================================================================================================
To run:
	$python prob1.py
	
Requirements:
	- program imports integrators from integrators.py, needs to be in working directory
	
Output:
	- twelve figures corresponding to the orbits of the two particles, the phase diagrams,
	  and the fractional energy changes for eccentricities of e = 0.5 and e = 0.9
	
=================================================================================================
Question 2
=================================================================================================
To run:
	mkdir animation
	python
	>>> import prob2 as p2
	>>> p2.nbody('LF2', 0.05, 0.05, 1000, 2, 'Initial_Conditions.txt')

Note: parameters in call to p2.nbody are (in order)
	1. integrator - RK4 of LF2
	2. softening parameter
	3. size of time step (~dynamical timescale/30)
	4. number of steps to take in integration (many times the dynamical timescale)
	5. output frequency
	6. initial conditions file

The above is an example run, the user can experiment with these parameters.

Requirements:
	- program imports integrators from integrators.py, needs to be in working directory
	- program imports initial conditions from Initial_Conditions.txt, must also be in 
	  working directory
	- program saves frames for animation to folder "animation", must also be in working
	  directory

Output:
	- Energy plot saved as either Energy_LF2.png or Energy_RK4.png, depending on which
	  integrator is chosen
	- Frames corresponding to positions of particles in xy-plane, frequency output 
	  depends on parameter provided by user when calling the program

For initial conditions:
	$python ics.py

Note: ics.py is set to generate initial conditions such that all particles lie in the xy-plane 
(z = 0) and with no motion in the z direction. This can be changed in lines 39, 41, 52, 
and 53.
