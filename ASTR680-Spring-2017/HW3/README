To run:
	$python prob1.py
	
Requirements:
	- none
	
Output:
	- prints to terminal the amount of matter a black hole needs to accrete to reach 
	  spin of nearly 1 (starting from 0) if it accretes in the prograde direction, 
	  and the amount of matter it needs to accrete to reach a spin of 0 (starting 
	  from nearly 1) if it accretes in the retrograde direction
	- figures named Prograde.png and Retrograde.png showing the dimensionless spin 
	  parameter as a function of black hole mass
Notes:
	- none
