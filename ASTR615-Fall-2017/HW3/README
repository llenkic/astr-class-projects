=========================================================================================
Question 1 
=========================================================================================
Part (a)
To run:
	$python prob1a.py
	
Requirements:
	- program imports integrators from integrators.py, needs to be in working directory
	
Output:
	- figure named Pop_Evolution.png with the results for time steps of 1, 0.5, 0.25,
	  and 0.1, where the * runs from 1 to 4
	- prints progress to screen

Part (b)
To run:
	$python prob1b.py

Requirements:
	- program imports integrators from integrators.py, needs to be in working directory

Output:
	- figure named Population_0.png, corresponding to a = b = q ~ 1.23, with time step
	  of 0.1
	- prints final population numbers to screen

Question 2
=========================================================================================
To run:
	$python prob2.py

Requirements:
	- program imports integrators from integrators.py, needs to be in working directory

Output:
	- The shape of the orbit: four figures named orbit_tstep*.png corresponding to time 
	  steps of 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1, where the * runs from 0 to 3
		- plots x position vs. y position
	- The energy of the orbit: four figures named energy_tstep*.png corresponding to time 
	  steps of 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1, where the * runs from 0 to 3
		- plot time vs. energy of orbit
	- In both plots the leapfrog integrator is colored blue and RK4 is colored green
